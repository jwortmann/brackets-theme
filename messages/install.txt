Thanks for installing!

To activate the theme, run "UI: Select Theme" from the command palette
and select "Brackets".

This theme uses custom file type icons in the sidebar. As a side effect,
file icons might not be displayed correctly when you switch to another
theme, like for example the built-in "Default" or "Adaptive" themes. To
restore the icons for those themes, disable this package by running
"Package Control: Disable Package" from the command palette and select
"Theme - Brackets".
