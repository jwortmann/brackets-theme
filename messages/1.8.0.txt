* This update includes a redesign of the file tabs to make it more obvious which tab
  is currently selected. There is a new setting "tab_shadows": true/false and it can
  be set to false in Preferences.sublime-settings to revert back to the flat tab style
  that was used before.

* Breaking change: The "blend_inactive_tabs" setting was renamed to
  "inactive_tab_transparency": true/false. It can be enabled if you prefer the style
  of inactive tabs from the Default and Adaptive themes. Now this setting also works
  if "file_tab_style" is set to "angled" or "wave".

* Added and updated a few file icons in the sidebar.

* Fixed popup border color with light color schemes if the "popup_style" setting is
  not used.

* Removed support for previously deprecated setting names, which were still
  functional before this update.
