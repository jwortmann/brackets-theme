* This release introduces new custom file type icons in the sidebar.
  As a side effect, file icons might not be displayed correctly when
  you switch to another theme, like for example the built-in "Default"
  or "Adaptive" themes. To restore the icons for those themes, disable
  this package by running "Package Control: Disable Package" from the
  command palette and select "Theme - Brackets".

* Popups in the editor area are now rendered with a border and rounded
  corners by default. You can revert to the old style by adding
  "popup_style": "plain" into your global settings ("Preferences: Settings"
  from the command palette).

* Added the ability to hide the tabs dropdown button by using the
  setting "hide_tabs_dropdown_button": true.
