* This update replaces the monochrome gray file type icons in the sidebar
  with full colored icons.

  In case you prefer the monochrome variant that was used before, you can
  still revert to the old icons with the following steps:
  1. Open "Preferences: Browse Packages" from the command palette
  2. Create a folder named "Theme - Brackets"
  3. Navigate into that folder and create another folder named "icons_mono"
  4. Navigate into that folder and create a file named "Brackets.sublime-theme"
     with the following content:

     [{"class": "icon_file_type", "layer0.tint": "#858e92"}]

  5. Restart Sublime Text

  So the location of the file should be like this:
  Windows:  %APPDATA%\Sublime Text\Packages\Theme - Brackets\icons_mono\Brackets.sublime-theme
  Mac:      ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text/Packages/Theme - Brackets/icons_mono/Brackets.sublime-theme
  Linux:    ~/.config/sublime_text/Packages/Theme - Brackets/icons_mono/Brackets.sublime-theme

  Please note that support for the monochrome icons might be dropped in a
  future release.

* New but unmodified tabs now have a green highlighting indicator, if the
  "highlight_modified_tabs" setting is enabled (only in ST build 4170 or newer).

* Added a new "theme_variant" setting which can be set to "winui" in order to
  apply an alternative style for the title bar, the side bar, autocomplete popups,
  and other UI elements, inspired by the Windows 11 Mica & Acrylic materials.
  This setting is currently experimental and it only works if "themed_title_bar"
  is enabled. You can also modify the background hue by overriding the "winui"
  color variable in a theme customization ("UI: Customize Theme" from the
  command palette).
