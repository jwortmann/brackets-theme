* This update replaces the monochrome gray file type icons in the sidebar
  with full colored icons.

  In case you prefer the monochrome variant that was used before, you can
  still revert the icons for now by following these steps:
  1. Open "Preferences: Browse Packages" from the command palette
  2. Create a folder named "Theme - Brackets"
  3. Navigate into that folder and create another folder named "icons_mono"
  4. Navigate into that folder and create a file named "Brackets.sublime-theme"
     with the following content:

     [{"class": "icon_file_type", "layer0.tint": "#858e92"}]

  5. Restart Sublime Text

  So the location of the file should look like this:
  "Packages/Theme - Brackets/icons_mono/Brackets.sublime-theme"

  Please note that support for the monochrome icons might be dropped in a
  future release.
