[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/jwortmann/brackets-theme)](https://github.com/jwortmann/brackets-theme/blob/master/LICENSE)
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/jwortmann/brackets-theme?label=version)](https://github.com/jwortmann/brackets-theme/releases)

A theme for Sublime Text inspired by Adobe Brackets.

This package only controlls the look of the user interface in Sublime Text.
For the according syntax highlighting schemes also see my [Brackets Color Scheme](https://github.com/jwortmann/brackets-color-scheme), which can be installed independently.

## Installation

The theme requires Sublime Text build 4107 or newer.
It can be installed with Sublime Text's package manager [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation).
From the command palette select *Package Control: Install Package* and search for *Theme - Brackets*.

## Customization

Various theme-related settings defined by Sublime Text, as well as a few custom settings specific to this theme are supported to tweak the appearance.
All settings should be modified in the *Preferences.sublime-settings* file, which can be opened via *Preferences > Settings* from the menu.

__Custom settings:__

| Setting | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| "kind_icons_style" | "octicons" | Controls the style for the kind icons which are shown in the autocompletion popup and the "Goto Symbol" panels. Options:<ul><li>"octicons" (from GitHub)</li><li>"gitlab" (from GitLab)</li><li>"codicons" (from VS Code)</li><li>"letters" (similar to the built-in themes)</li></ul> |
| "git_status_icons" | "octicons" | Controls the style for the git status icons for files and folders in the sidebar. Options:<ul><li>"octicons"</li><li>"codicons"</li><li>"disabled"</li> |
| "sidebar_status_colors" | false | Highlight filenames in the sidebar for files with Git status "new" or "modified" in green and orange. Regardless of this setting, files with status "ignored" are always dimmed. |
| "popup_style" | "rounded" | Controls the style for hover popups. Options are "plain", "rounded" and "square". When set to "rounded" or "square", popups will be drawn with a border. |
| "tooltip_style" | "dark" | Controls the style for tooltips. Options are "dark" and "light". |
| "scroll_bar_style" | "auto" | Controls the style for scroll bars. Options are "brackets", "sublime", "thin" and "auto". The "auto" option uses "sublime" when overlay scroll bars are enabled, and "brackets" when disabled. |
| "fold_buttons_style" | "triangle" | Controls the style for the buttons shown in the gutter to fold regions of text. Options are "triangle" and "square". |
| "hide_tabs_dropdown_button" | false | Hides the tabs dropdown button. |

## File Icons

This theme uses custom file type icons in the sidebar.
As a side effect, file icons might not be displayed correctly when you switch to another theme, like for example the built-in *Default* or *Adaptive* themes.
To restore the icons for those themes, disable this package by running *Package Control: Disable Package* from the command palette and select *Theme - Brackets*.
