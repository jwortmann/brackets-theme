# Brackets Theme for Sublime Text

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/jwortmann/brackets-theme)](https://github.com/jwortmann/brackets-theme/blob/master/LICENSE)

A theme for Sublime Text inspired by Adobe Brackets.

## Installation

This theme requires Sublime Text build 4107 or newer.
At this time, the theme can be manually installed by copying all files from this repository into a folder named *Theme - Brackets* under the *Packages* directory (*Preferences > Browse Packages* from the menu).

## Preview


## Settings

This theme supports various default theme-related settings, which can be configured in the global preferences file.
Additionally, `"kind_letters": true` allows to use the default style with colored kind letters instead of icons in autocompletion popups and the *Goto Symbol…* panel.

## Attributions

Kind icons used in the autocompletion popup and the *Goto Symbol…* panel are adapted from Microsoft's [Codicons](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-codicons) icon font (licensed under [CC BY 4.0](/kind_icons/LICENSE)).
