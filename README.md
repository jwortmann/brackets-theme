A theme for Sublime Text inspired by Adobe Brackets.

This package only controlls the look of the user interface in Sublime Text.
For the according syntax highlighting schemes also see my [Brackets Color Scheme](https://github.com/jwortmann/brackets-color-scheme), which can be installed independently.

## Installation

The theme requires Sublime Text build 4107 or newer.
It can be installed with Sublime Text's package manager [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation).
From the command palette select *Package Control: Install Package* and search for *Theme - Brackets*.
